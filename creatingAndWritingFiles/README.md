## Scenario
Earlier today your boss approached you about some business client reports they need submitted for next week in addition to your current work. 
The same week you are to organise and lead the event at a local school and are beginning to feel the pressure. 
You want to create a 'To Do' list to plan your days ahead.

## Problem

<p>
Create a program to take the names of 3 tasks as input and write them down in the file "tasks.txt", each on a new line.
Make use of the readFile() method to output.
