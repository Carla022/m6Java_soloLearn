# Threads

## Problem

<p>
A registration program for our app. At first it should 
Write the program so that it Welcome the users, then ask the users to enter their names - <i>Extend</i> the Thread class for Welcome and Name classes, then set priorities for their run methods so that the program outputs the messages in the correct order.
