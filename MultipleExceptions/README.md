# Multiple Exception

## Problem

<p>
  You need to write a divider program which will operate with integers,
The program you are given should take two integers as input and execute the division, but we need to handle two exceptions:
1. the divider shouldn't be zero
2. both inputs should be integers.
Complete the program to handle them. For the first exception, the program should output "Mistake: division by zero"; and for the second one, "Mistake: wrong value type".
